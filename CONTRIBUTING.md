## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to projects can be in the form of bug reports or feature requests
via issues or pull requests. Pull requests are preferred method of contribution
to a project.

### Reporting Issues/Bugs

Issues are the best way to file a bug report to a project. Before filing an
issue, please check for the following:

- Attempt to replicate your problem to ensure it can be repeated and isn't
  coincidental.
- Ensure that your feature request is within the scope of the project. For
  example, please don't suggest to add Drupal support to a WordPress plugin. If
  you are unsure, try making a discussion post in the project to ask the project
  maintainers.
- Search the repository for an existing issue/pull request to your issue/feature
  request. Check to make sure that your issue wasn't already reported/requested.
