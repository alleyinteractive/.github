## Alley: The digital agency for publishers

Our mission is to reclaim the internet as an awesome place to work, play, and explore. We create digital solutions that connect people to news, entertainment, ideas — and to each other. We seek to build a world of authentic collaboration where teams deliver their best work in an environment of mutual trust, support, and respect.

Alley provides industry-leading software development, data visualization, audience research, user experience, visual design, and strategy services. Our clients are major media companies, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies that influence public opinion in news, entertainment, and policy.

Our team's primary programming languages for development are PHP and TypeScript/ES Next JavaScript (with a focus on React), which are critical to our commitment to staying at the forefront of WordPress and Gutenberg development.

Alley was founded in 2010. Since then, we’ve grown into a globally-distributed team of developers, designers, and strategists working across a diverse range of projects. We use open-source tools and technologies such as WordPress and pride ourselves on accessible and inclusive design and development practices. We are dedicated to meeting the business goals of our clients, making life easier for writers and editors, and the web a better place for their audiences.

We offer competitive salaries, health insurance, vision and dental insurance, life insurance, short and long term disability, 401k with company matching, profit sharing, and a flexible time off policy. We also provide a monthly lunch stipend, an equipment allowance, and a professional development budget.
